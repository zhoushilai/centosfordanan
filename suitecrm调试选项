To Setup Crontab
In order to run SuiteCRM Schedulers, edit your web server user's crontab file with this command:
sudo crontab -e -u apache
... and add the following line to the crontab file:
*    *    *    *    *     cd /data/www/lsuitecrm; php -f cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1
You should do this only after the installation is concluded.
